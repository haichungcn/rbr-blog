# README

This is my **experimental** blog built on top of the awesome ✨ **Ruby on Rails 6** ✨, since 27 July 2020.

Weblog is aimed to be a platform where people can share their ideas as well as interact via comments with each others.

I would be really appreciated if you could leave some feedbacks on the site or what I can improve via (my email)[haichungcn@gmail.com] ✉️ or the form in Contact section.
